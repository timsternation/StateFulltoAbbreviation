# StateFulltoAbbreviation
##Code for converting U.S. state full names to abbreviations in Power Query M language

This is code you can plug into Power Query in Microsoft Excel or Power BI if you need to convert U.S. state names to their abbreviations. 

Note that this is NOT something that would work in DAX, but rather in the M language when you're setting up your data connection.

You'll need to change the part of the code that informs WHERE in the process this step fits in ("Reordered Columns" in the example) and also the name of the column you're editing ([AREA_TITLE]) in the example.
